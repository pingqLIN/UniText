# Cloudflare Tunnel DNS

## Scope

- Tunnel IDs and credentials files
- DNS hostnames for MCP and health
- Ingress to local ports
- Public endpoint reachability

## Use This Skill When

- You need to confirm the active tunnel target.
- You need to update hostname to ingress mappings.
- You need to verify health and MCP routes from the public edge.

## Do Not Use This Skill When

- The issue is only about WARP, split tunnel vs full tunnel, or local Zero Trust device policy.
- The issue is only about Access OAuth, DCR, or redirect URIs.
- The issue is only about WAF, browser check, or bot policy.

## Checks

- Tunnel ID and name
- Credentials file path
- Hostname -> local port mapping
- `/health` and `/mcp` routing

## Change Guardrails

- Before adding a new tunnel, hostname, or ingress rule, capture the health of existing active tunnels and their public health endpoints.
- After adding or starting a new tunnel, re-run the same health checks for the pre-existing tunnels and compare results before treating the change as successful.
- Do not trade one working tunnel for another without calling out the regression and the exact service, config file, and hostname affected.

## Escalate

- Use [cloudflare-governance](../cloudflare-governance/SKILL.md) first for broad Cloudflare review, or when hostname routing changes also require Access policy, edge security, runtime review, or WARP/device investigation.
- Use [cloudflare-zerotrust-device](../cloudflare-zerotrust-device/SKILL.md) when the request is primarily about WARP pathing or full-tunnel vs split-tunnel behavior.
